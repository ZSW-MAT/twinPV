// specific electrical resistivity rho of a material is an exponential function of the thickness 'z'
// rho(z) = rho_Bulk + (rho_Thin - rho_Bulk) * exp(-decay * z)
// for a constant resistivity, enter the same value for 'bulk' and 'thin layer' (decay coefficient doesn't matter in this case)

// specific electrical resistivity in [Ohm*m] within the bulk of this material
resistivity bulk:
3.7e-6

// specific electrical resistivity in [Ohm*m] for an imaginary infinitesimal thin layer of this material
resistivity infinitesimal thin layer:
3.7e-6

// determines how fast the resistivity goes from 'infinitesimal resisitivity' to 'bulk resistivity' [1/m]
decay coefficient:
0
